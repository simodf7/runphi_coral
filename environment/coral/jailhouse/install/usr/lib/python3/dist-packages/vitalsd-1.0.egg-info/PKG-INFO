Description: vitalsd - Statistics for Embedded Systems
        =========================================
        
        ## What is this?
        
        vitalsd is a very simple tool that samples vital system statistics (CPU load,
        free/total memory, temperatures, etc.) and outputs them periodically to a serial
        port. It's designed to be used on embedded systems with physical serial ports
        that can crash in unexpected ways that leave the system in a non-triageable
        state.
